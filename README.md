<h2>Background of the project</h2>
<p>Hobby/learning project to get more comfortable with fullstack programming. The code you see here is not in any way professional and at the moment it's pretty messy.</p>

<p>Currently the project has been on a pause for few years but I thought that I should put it up anyway. I'm trying to get back to it and make it clearer and document it better.</p>
