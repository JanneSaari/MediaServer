Downloading jQuery
Compressed and uncompressed copies of jQuery files are available. The uncompressed file is best used during development or debugging;
the compressed file saves bandwidth and improves performance in production. You can also download a sourcemap file for use when 
debugging with a compressed file. The map file is not required for users to run jQuery, it just improves the developer's debugger experience. 
As of jQuery 1.11.0/2.1.0 the //# sourceMappingURL comment is not included in the compressed file.
